## Codecademy Project Mixed Messages

For this project, I built a message generator program. 
*Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.

### Project Objectives:
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

### Project Status:
In progress. 
The program currently is an Affirmation Generator, randomly generating an affirmation without any parameters.

#### Programs Used:
*VSCode V 1.51.1*
*Javascript, Markdown and Git*
